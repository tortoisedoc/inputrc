What is this?
--------------------

This is a simple inputrc file with shortcuts to have easy git
usability via keyboard (and avoiding overtyping).

Tested on bash, but *might* be compatible with all shells that
support readline library.

Current limitations:

- supports only comment entries per-file, i.e. one staged entry at the time.
